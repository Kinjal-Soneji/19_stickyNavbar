# Sticky Navbar Project

## Description
A simple web application demonstrating a sticky navigation bar that remains fixed at the top of the page when scrolling.

## Features
- Responsive navbar
- Sticky navigation on scroll
- Multiple content sections (Home, About, Services, Portfolio, Contact)
- Smooth hover effects on navbar links

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript

## Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser

## How It Works
The navbar becomes fixed to the top of the page when the user scrolls past its original position. The JavaScript tracks the navbar's initial position and adds/removes a CSS class to create the sticky effect.

## Files
- `index.html`: Main HTML structure
- `style.css`: Styling for the page
- `main.js`: JavaScript for sticky navbar functionality
